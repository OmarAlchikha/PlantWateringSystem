# Java Plant Watering System
In this project, an automated plant watering system is designed and developed through a Java application interfaced with an Arduino-compatible device. The system can monitor soil moisture content to the extent that it can auto-activate a water pump when it is too dry. An OLED screen displays real-time data about moisture levels and pump status.
